# Contributing to QueryHub

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This document describes how to get started and the expectations for contributors.

## Getting started
- Fork the repository and clone your fork locally.
- Install the project using `pip install -e .[dev]` to make sure all development dependencies are available.
- Create a new branch for each change you plan to make.

## Development workflow
1. Make your changes in small, logical commits.
2. Run `ruff check` and `pytest` locally to ensure the codebase stays healthy.
3. Update documentation and tests alongside code changes.
4. Open a pull request that clearly states the problem being solved and the solution you implemented.

## Code style and quality
- Follow the style enforced by Ruff and the Python standard library.
- Keep functions small and focused; prefer readability over cleverness.
- Add type hints where practical.
- Include or update tests whenever you fix a bug or add new features.

## Reporting bugs and requesting features
- Use the issue templates to provide as much context as possible.
- Search for existing issues before opening a new one to avoid duplicates.

## Community guidelines
- Be respectful and constructive in all interactions.
- Review the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before participating.
