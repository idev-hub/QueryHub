# QueryHub Documentation

QueryHub is a config-driven platform that reads YAML definitions to execute asynchronous queries against diverse data sources, render the results into HTML, and deliver the output via email. This documentation covers:

- **Concepts** – configuration hierarchy, provider model, rendering pipeline, and email delivery.
- **Guides** – step-by-step tutorials for installing QueryHub, writing YAML configs, and wiring new providers.
- **Reference** – CLI commands, configuration schema, and API entry points.
